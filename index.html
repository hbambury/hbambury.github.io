<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>This is <a href="https://hbambury.github.io/">Henry Bambury</a>'s academic webpage.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p> I am a PhD student at <i>Ecole Normale Superieure</i> and <i>Inria</i> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~pnguyen/">Phong Nguyen</a>. My research has to do with the use of number theory and algorithms in post-quantum cryptography. Currently, I am interested in algorithms that find short vectors in ideal lattices, and in the distribution of these ideal lattices. </p>
